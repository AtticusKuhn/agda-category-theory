# Agda Category Theory

The purpose of this project is to use the programming language Agda to formalise certain
concepts in category theory. I am using the book "Categories for the Working Mathematician"
by Saunders MacLane, and manually translating from math notation to cubical Agda.
If you do not know how to use Agda, I have an english-language tutorial on category
theory on my website at [https://atticusmkuhn.com/notes/a43dcee8-d5df-4a3b-affe-9531133eb8df](https://atticusmkuhn.com/notes/a43dcee8-d5df-4a3b-affe-9531133eb8df)
